The organization is an online institution that offers tech related courses.
My main aim was to analyze and look at the applications that we received from the intake. With this data I want to know;

How the gender is distributed per program applied?
The level of education of the applicants when applying for the program?
The program with the highest number of applicants?
The current status of the students while applying for the programs?
Where the applicants learnt about us?
